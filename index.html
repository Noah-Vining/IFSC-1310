<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
<P>Progressive Enhancement is a way of designing websites in a way that caters to as many users as possible, specifically giving the most modern and fully equipped users the full experience while still allowing more limited and less modern users a good, but not as full, experience. It is meant to be a sort of replacement for graceful deterioration, which attempts to give the full experience to every user, but allow less modern users to experience any bugs or quirks that might come with using an older browser. Progressive Enhancement attempts to remove any bugs or glitches from the equations, as giving users a less full but more stable experience is seen as a better alternative. </P>

<p>It is an important new design philosophy as it greatly helps users, allowing them to be able to use a website, its features, and its content all consistently across browsers and devices. A website built off of graceful deterioration may include a bug that prevents certain users from using it or getting the content they need from it, but issues like that are specifically designed not to happen with progressive enhancement, and in a day and age where websites are constantly being accessed from a vast number of different types of devices and browsers, it's very important to allow all of them to access your website. </p>

<p>Another article that goes into progressive enhancement even deeper than the original article, even going into how to use progressive enhancement is linked down below.</p>
