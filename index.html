<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
<P>Progressive Enhancement is a way of designing websites in a way that caters to as many users as possible, specifically giving the most modern and fully equipped users the full experience while still allowing more limited and less modern users a good, but not as full, experience. It is meant to be a sort of replacement for graceful deterioration, which attempts to give the full experience to every user, but allow less modern users to experience any bugs or quirks that might come with using an older browser. Progressive Enhancement attempts to remove any bugs or glitches from the equations, as giving users a less full but more stable experience is seen as a better alternative. </P>

<p>It is an important new design philosophy as it greatly helps users, allowing them to be able to use a website, its features, and its content all consistently across browsers and devices. A website built off of graceful deterioration may include a bug that prevents certain users from using it or getting the content they need from it, but issues like that are specifically designed not to happen with progressive enhancement, and in a day and age where websites are constantly being accessed from a vast number of different types of devices and browsers, it's very important to allow all of them to access your website. </p>

<p>Another article that goes into progressive enhancement even deeper than the original article, even going into how to use progressive enhancement is linked down below.</p>

  <h2>Reflection Assignment</h2>
  <p>For my final exam project, I learned quite a bit about how well I do with the HTML, CSS, and Javascript parts of building a web page. I feel I'm best with html, as its simplicity and very objective nature make it kind of hard to be bad at. </p>
<p>I feel I’m not as confident in my CSS making but still confident overall. It’s not really the code part of CSS that I have trouble with, but rather the actual design part, as I’m not really good with designing things. That being said I do think I did my web page design pretty well and I like it, though part of me wonders if I needed to think up more original aspects of the design than I maybe I did, and that might be something I would have changed if I had to start over. </p>
<p>JavaScript would have to be the aspect of webpage building that I am the least confident in, though that’s probably just due to my lack of experience with it. I had some trouble implementing the slideshow into my page (mostly trying to style it without breaking it) but I feel I did a good job. Though I realize I have a lot more to learn with it, and do regret that I had other things I attempted to implement into my web page that I couldn’t get to work. </p>
<p>For my feedback, I asked a couple of my friends for help. Most of what they had to say in terms of criticism came from how mismatched the bottom picture and text on the mainpage felt, which I believe I managed to fix by adding in the slideshow to the section, giving it a more complete look that fits with detailing parts of the dragon. I also received a complaint about the top of the page’s background image contrasting a little bit too much with the rest of the sections, which I fixed by altering the image’s transparency. </p>
<p>I feel I did good this semester and most definitely learned a lot. At the beginning of it, I basically did not know a single thing about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, much less how to actually use them. So I feel good knowing that I’ve managed to learn enough to do at least this much with it.</p>
